First of all, let me introduce myself to you! My name is Tamas Veiland, a 38 year old software developer. 
Yes, I always call myself a software developer, however I spend lots of time working on CI/CD pipelines and
other aspects of Application Lifecycle Management (ALM).

I started working at Microsoft in 2015. Since then, I'm very interested in cloud technologies as well. To be more specific, I continuously seek opportunities to improve my knowledge of Azure and its surrounding technologies.
