This is the third part of the series that I started for describing SharePoint customization creation for multiple farms. If you haven't read the first 2 posts, I recommend to do so:

[Generate extensions for multiple SharePoint farms (classic experience)](../10/SharePoint-customization-for-multiple-farms-classic.html)

[Generate extensions for multiple SharePoint farms (modern experience)](../29/SharePoint-customization-for-multiple-farms-spfx.html)

In this post, I'll elaborate on how to automate solution generation with Azure DevOps Services for multiple SharePoint farms.
